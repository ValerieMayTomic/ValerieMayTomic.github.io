            <b>Technology and writing have long been my twin passions. </b>Ever since I first circled "Intro to Law" and "Intro to Programming" as my top choice electives in my first year of high school, I have known that my path lies at the crux of these increasingly interconnected fields. <br><br>

            As a student of both <b>Computer Science </b>and <b>Classics </b>at Brown University, I combined my diverse academic interests to strengthen my skills in a variety of technical and non-technical disciplines. Through advanced coursework in both the sciences and the humanities, I have not only gained a deep understanding of cutting-edge technology, but also developed strong skills in writing, analytical reading, and research.<br><br>

            In my studies of Computer Science, I focused my attention on both <b>the foundational and the innovative</b>. I gained a strong background in the mathematics and theory of computation, yet I was equally passionate about increasing my knowledge in cutting-edge areas like cybersecurity and deep learning. My studies in the field of Classics helped me develop still further critical skills: I exceled in writing-heavy courses that required students to perform significant independent research, such as Ancient Law, and I received high praise for my ability to verbally present complex information in a clear and effective manner.<br><br>

            My experiences <b>working in technology and law</b> have allowed me to further expand my skillset. Through my work as a Technology Specialist and Patent Agent at Wolf Greenfield and my internships at MITRE, I have gained an ability to quickly develop a working knowledge of new technical ideas through focused research and practical experience. I also honed my ability to understand and evaluate complicated technical concepts as an instructor in cybersecurity and cryptography at iD Tech, where every day involved taking advanced technical ideas, condensing them to their most critical components, and presenting them to students in a compelling and comprehensible manner.<br><br>

            My multidisciplinary academic background, combined with my broad range of technical and legal work experience, have made me a lightning-quick learner and a highly adaptable team member, capable of excelling in fast-paced and demanding environments. I am passionate about doing work that combines my knowledge of technology with my experience as a writer, researcher, and communicator. <b>I look forward to connecting with you!</b><br><br><br>
